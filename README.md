## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).
Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight
(EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Advent of Code 2022 Story

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on
Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The
Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough [magical energy](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/25), the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum
of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab
any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second
puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
